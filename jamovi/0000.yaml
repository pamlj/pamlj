  (beta) A suite for power analysis for linear models. At the moment, it allows
  for power analysis of Pearson correlation, the general linear model
  (t-test/Correlation/Anova/Regression/ANCOVA) and other statistical tests, such
  as mediation. For the GLM the analysis can be based on standardized
  coefficients (regression), proportion of partial variance effect sizes
  (Eta-squared, Omega-Squared, Epsilon-Squared), or means and standard
  deviations. It provides estimation of required sample size, power and
  minimally-detectable effect size, plus plots for sensitivity analysis.
