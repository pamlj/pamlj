  A suite for power analysis for linear models. At the moment, it allows for
  power analysis of Pearson correlation, the general linear model
  (t-test/Correlation/Anova/Regression/ANCOVA) and other statistical tests, such
  as mediation, structural equation models, llinear mixed models.  For the GLM
  the analysis can be based on standardized coefficients (regression),
  proportion of partial variance effect sizes (Eta-squared, Omega-Squared,
  Epsilon-Squared), or means and standard deviations. It provides estimation of
  required sample size, power and minimally-detectable effect size, plus plots
  for sensitivity analysis.
