description: (beta) A suite for power analysis for linear models. At the moment, it
    allows for power analysis of Pearson correlation, the general linear model (t-test/Correlation/Anova/Regression/ANCOVA)
    and other statistical tests, such as mediation. For the GLM the analysis can be
    based on standardized coefficients (regression), proportion of partial variance
    effect sizes (Eta-squared, Omega-Squared, Epsilon-Squared), or means and standard
    deviations. It provides estimation of required sample size, power and minimally-detectable
    effect size, plus plots for sensitivity analysis.
