Description:   (beta) A suite for power analysis for linear models. It allows for
               power analysis of Pearson correlation, the general linear model
               (t-test/Correlation/Anova/Regression/ANCOVA) and other statistical tests, such as
               mediation models, structural equations model, tests on proportions, and more.
               It provides estimation of required sample size, power and minimally-detectable
               effect size, plus plots for sensitivity analysis.
